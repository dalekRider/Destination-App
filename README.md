# Destination-App

This project was created by completing the Wanderlust project through CodeCademy's JavaScript Course. The information retrieved and populated on this page uses the APIXU API for weather and the FourSquare API for attractions. This page is a modified version of my original solution to the project and was created for addtional practice.

There are all sorts of information available from these APIs. I have only grabbed a few property values to showcase just how dynamic these APIs are. If you are interested in learning just what information you can get from them, be sure to check out the documentation available from the last two links! Enjoy
