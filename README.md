# Destination-App
This project was created by completing the Wanderlust project through CodeCademy's JavaScript Course. The information retrieved and populated on this page uses the APIXU API for weather and the FourSquare API for attractions. This page is a modified version of my original solution to the project and was created for addtional practice.

After tweaking this project a bit I also realize this may be a perfect use case for CSS Grid. Fallback support should be pretty simple. I'll probably redo the layout more at some point. This goes with the list of projects that will get upgrades for sleeker looks and better accessibility.
